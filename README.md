## Funcionality

Upon loading, users will see a key map for different sounds based on which key is pressed. After a key is pressed, the user hears the associated sound play immediately. The user may press multiple keys at once to create class drum patterns, like kick on the 1 and 3, snare on the 2 and 4, and closed hat on every 1/8th note.

Users have the option to sing along with their favorite songs by searching for the song title. The search result brings a link to the lyrics for the song, and pull gifs associated with that song name. Users can make their own stripped down remixes during live shows, jamming with friends, or an intimate concert for one.

Whether users are experienced musicians or first time percussionists, the PKDX-004 provides users with a fun, easy to use drum machine with the classic sounds of the Roland TR-909 drum machine. We hope you enjoy using the PKDX-004 and share with your friends!
